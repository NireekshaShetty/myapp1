 <p><em><b><font color="white">I love u loads my love. I never expected ever that you'd mean so much to me. I never even thought that we'll even get close to each other.    
It just happened in the flow Kaushik.It's like a snowstorm. It's like you know and you see that snow is falling on some place. But you don't know that they are adding up together to cover that full place and at the end when you see its beautiful. 
Fully covered with snow. That's why I said you're my snowstorm :*
I love you. I don't regularly send how much u mean to me by those nice texts like how you do. But you mean a lot to me and that's very true.
I don't want u to go away from me. You should always be with me because I love u so much. I get irritated and change my tune when I talk to you. But trust me when I talk that way to any person it means they mean a lot to me. I never wanted to hurt you motte. 
That's how I'll be when I get irritated. I'm sorry. You're my love and you're mine n you're Nireeksha's Kaushik. 

I love you because I can't spend a day without talking to you. I miss you even if I talk to you.. you are a part of my life now. I like spending time with you. You mean a lot to me now.. you're my motte sweetheart and I just love to irritate you. 
Can't imagine a day without talking to you. You're special. You're mine. I like you more and I miss you loads.  Muah :* <3 </font></b></em></p>
